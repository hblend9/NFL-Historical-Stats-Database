# NFL-Historical-Stats-Database

A SQL database of NFL Historical Statistics. Completed as part of Caltech's CS121: Intro to Relational Databases course.

Csv files with our nfl data attained from kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/kendallgillies/nflstatistics.

To load this data, access the cleaned csv files given by us. In our load-data file, we access the csv files locally, but have put them on our Github and uploaded them on CodePost. Next, to load the data from the command-line into MySQL run the following commands:

$ cd files:

$ mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p

mysql> source setup.sql;

mysql> source load-data.sql; (NOTE that there may be some warnings here, but these deal with loading NULL values into the tables)

mysql> source setup-passwords.sql;

mysql> source setup-routines.sql;

mysql> source grant-permissions.sql;

mysql> source queries.sql;

mysql> quit;

$ python3 app-admin.py

OR

$ python3 app-client.py

Now, you should either be in the admin or the client program.

For admin:

(l) - log into the app with admin information

(d) - add new data to the NFL database (passing table for simplicity)

(q) - quit the python program

For client:

(a) - view all the hall of fame players

(t) - view all hall of fame players and their corresponding teams (includes players who played for multiple teams)

(c) - view teams with most hall of fame players

(q) - quit the python program
