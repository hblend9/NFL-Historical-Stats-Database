Eli Seiner and Halle Blend.

This client application allows the user to get information about the hall of fame
like checking all the names that are in the hall of fame, geting the name of the
player in the hall of fame from the selected team, and counting the number of
different teams with a player in the hall of fame.
There is also command line functionality to provide easy use for the user:
(a) to view all hall of fame players
(t) to view all hall of fame players and their corresponding teams
    (includes players who played for multiple teams)
(c) to view teams with most hall of fame players
(q) to quit the program
